### **Problem Statement:** The economic challenges faced by underprivileged individuals with limited education in accessing loans and securing suitable employment despite possessing valuable skills.
  
**Description:** In today's society, economic inequality remains a persistent problem, affecting vulnerable populations who lack access to resources and opportunities. Among these individuals, a significant issue arises when attempting to obtain loans or secure employment, even when possessing relevant skills. This problem statement aims to highlight the challenges faced by economically weak and uneducated individuals who possess valuable skills but struggle to utilise them effectively due to systemic barriers.
  
### **Problem Analysis:**  

1. **Limited Financial Resources:** Economic weak individuals often lack the financial means to pursue education and vocational training programs, hindering their skill development. As a result, they may possess valuable skills but lack formal certifications or degrees required for job placement and loan eligibility.
2. **Lack of Creditworthiness:** Many financial institutions require a certain level of creditworthiness to grant loans. However, individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds often lack access to credit and may have a limited or negative credit history. This lack of creditworthiness hampers their ability to secure loans, hindering their entrepreneurial aspirations or investment in income-generating ventures.
3. **Limited Network and Resources:** Economic weak individuals often face limited networking opportunities and lack access to platforms that can connect them to suitable job openings or potential employers. Without an extensive network, they may struggle to showcase their skills and find employment opportunities that align with their abilities.
4. **Discrimination and Bias:** Socioeconomic status and educational background can contribute to discrimination and bias during the job application process. Employers may prefer candidates with higher educational qualifications or favour individuals from more privileged backgrounds. This bias often results in the exclusion of qualified but economically weak candidates, preventing them from utilising their skills effectively.
5. **Skills Mismatch:** In some cases, there may be a mismatch between the skills possessed by economically weak individuals and the available job opportunities in their local labor markets. This discrepancy can further limit their chances of finding suitable employment, resulting in underemployment or unemployment despite their skills.  
**Objective:** The objective is to address the challenges faced by economically weak and uneducated individuals in utilizing their valuable skills effectively. By identifying and mitigating the barriers to accessing loans and securing suitable employment, this problem statement seeks to promote equal opportunities and inclusive economic growth for all members of society, regardless of their socioeconomic background or educational level.  
  
### **Methodology / Approach**  
Garib caters to different marginalised communities and individuals, helping them overcome their state of absolute poverty. It explores different pathways to help the individual. We strongly believe everyone has assets in some or the other way, be it land, jewellery or their skills!

The different ways by which we intend to curb poverty are:

**_Credit score assessment:_** Generally many marginalised communities are not very much educated. Even though they have resources(e.g. Land,gold,water sources), they are unable to utilise them fully due to lack of paperwork. This deprives them of getting loans and investments. Our app helps in giving them a credit rating, based on which they can be provided with funds and partnership opportunities from financial institutions and investors.

**_Skill assessment:_** Sometimes people may not have capital or assets, but they may have skills which can make them employable. Our app assesses an individual’s skills & matches them to a potential client’s need via machine learning, helping them be employed.

**_Schemes eligibility:_** In extreme cases, a person might not have any assets or skills. Fortunately, many governmental as well as non governmental schemes are applicable to such people. However due to lack of awareness, they miss these opportunities. Our app scrapes all such opportunities and uses artificial intelligence to provide the best schemes, they are eligible for.

### **Technologies Used**
    
**Intel Dev Cloud And Intel OneAPI:** We harnessed OneAPI's versatile framework to optimize our machine learning model. This ensured efficient utilization of available resources. To speed up training, we used Intel's DevCloud, a cloud-based environment, to distribute workloads across multiple CPUs and GPUs, reducing training time through parallel processing.
  
**TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras:** These machine learning and deep learning frameworks are used to develop and train models that classify a child's growth status based on collected data. These frameworks provide a wide range of tools, algorithms, and pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for accurate classification.
  
**Android Studio with Java:** Android Studio with Java is a powerful combination for developing Android applications. Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development, providing a comprehensive set of tools and resources to streamline the development process. Java, a widely-used programming language, serves as the primary language for Android app development, offering reliability and versatility while adding functionality to the Application( as backend language).
  
**Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication :** Firebase, played a crucial role in enhancing the app's functionality. Firebase Realtime Database allowed for seamless data synchronization across devices in real-time, enabling users to access and share information effortlessly. Firebase Authentication provided a secure and hassle-free way for users to log in and interact with the app's features while maintaining their privacy.
  
**Web Scraping:** In this project, we will utilise web scraping techniques using Python and various tools. Our objective is to extract government schemes from the official website while prioritising security and authentication. To achieve this, we will employ technologies such as Requests for making HTTP requests and other essential libraries to facilitate the scraping process
